# Device Simulator
------------------
(C) 2010 by Christof Konstantinopoulos

This program simulates hardware devices at the serial port. 
It can also "learn" the communication behaviour of real
devices.

It will be working as a "man in the middle" device, so 
neither the Device, nor the other software parts has to know
something about the simulator. 

Use "Virtual Serial Port Drivers" to connect the simulator with
the other local Software. The optional connection to the real device
is done via the real serial ports.
